# Polar_express
The purpose of the project is to learn the mapping from polar coordinates to a a discrete 10x10 grid of cells in the plane, using a neural network. 
The supervised dataset is given to you in the form of a generator (to be considered as a black box).
The model must achieve an accuracy of 95%, and it will be evaluated in a way **inversely proportional to the number of its parameters: the smaller, the better.**
